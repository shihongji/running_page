# tzfpy [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tzfpy)](https://pypi.org/project/tzfpy/) [![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/tzfpy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/tzfpy/)

It's probably the fastest Python package to convert longitude/latitude to
timezone name.

NOTE:

1. This package use a simplified polygon data and not so accurate around
   borders.
2. Rust use lazzy init, so first calling will be a little slow.
3. Use about 40MB memory.

It's tested under Python 3.9+ but support 3.7+(noqa).

## Usage

Please note that new timezone names may be added to tzfpy, which could be
incompatible with old version package like pytz. As an option, tzfpy supports
install compatible version of those packages with extra params.

```bash
# Install just tzfpy
pip install tzfpy

# Install tzfpy with pytz
pip install "tzfpy[pytz]"
```

```python
>>> from tzfpy import get_tz, get_tzs
>>> get_tz(116.3883, 39.9289)
'Asia/Shanghai'
>>> get_tzs(87.4160, 44.0400)
['Asia/Shanghai', 'Asia/Urumqi']
```

## Background

`tzfpy` was originally written in Go named [`tzf`][tzf] and use CGO compiled to
`.so` to be used by Python. Since `v0.11.0` it's rewritten in Rust built on PyO3
and [`tzf-rs`][tzf-rs], a tzf's Rust port.
